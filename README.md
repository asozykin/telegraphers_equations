# "Long lines", or the Telegrapher's equations demo.
A demo for the lab coursework on electricity taught at the MSOU university in 2001-2003. Written in C++ Builder as a part of my summer practice in applied maths and programming at MSTU Stankin. Featured dynamic 2D charts and static 3D chats of the solutions of the Telegraphers equations.
